# GEANT4-MinimalWorkingExample3WithEclipseIDE
Here is a trapezoidal target with a spherical body within inself which can serve either as a cavity or as a denser obstruction to radiation by changing the material types of either body (hard-coded here for simplicity). The main electromagnetic interactions are enabled in the PhysicsList class.
