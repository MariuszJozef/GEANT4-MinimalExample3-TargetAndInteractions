# GEANT4-MinimalWorkingExample3WithEclipseIDE
Here we add a target body within the cuboidal lab with which radiation can interact - simple interactions are enabled in the PhysicsList class. The target can be rotated at runtime (without recompiling) thanks to a DetectorMessenger class. Likewise the target material and position of particle gun can be adjusted, no hardcoded values.
